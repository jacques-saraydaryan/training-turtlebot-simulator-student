# ROS Navigation Tutorial

## 0. Introduction

The following document presents an incremental overview of the different ROS configuration files and parameters used in Ros Navigation Package.
Before starting have a look to the following resources:
 - ROS [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) documentation
 - ROS [Nav2 general concepts](https://navigation.ros.org/concepts/index.html) documentation
 - ROS [Nav2 costmap_2d](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-costmaps.html) documentation
 - ROS [Nav2 costmap_2d github](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-costmaps.html) package

Most of navigation concepts come from ROS1 also have a look to 
 - ROS wiki page of [Basic Navigation Tuning Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide)
 - The excellent ROS navigation tuning guide providing by Kaiyu Zheng [here](http://kaiyuzheng.me/documents/navguide.pdf)

- A Complete introduction is also available here

## 1. Start Simulation and Mapping
### 1.1. Start simulator for mapping
- Follow the instructions provided in the section **Start Simulation for mapping** of the [readme.md](./readme.md).
### 1.2. Configure Rviz 
- Configure Rviz to see the following:
  - Map generated (topic `/map`)
  - Laser information (topic `/scan`)
    - `Style`: Boxes
    - `Size`: 0.07
    - `Color Transformer`: FlatColor
    - `Color`: 255; 0; 0
  
### 1.3 Map the environment
  - Begin to map the environment with the teleop
  - Once a first map is received change the fixed frame of `rviz` to `/map`.
  > - What happened when the robot move ? Why ?
  - Remember how the map is built (behaviour of affordance map)
  > - What happened when your robot tries to map a long corridor ? Explain

### 1.4 Map files
  - After mapping some rooms, save your map with the following command (you can see references here [https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/docs/navigation2_with_slam.html](https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/docs/navigation2_with_slam.html)):

  ```
    ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
  ```
  - 2 files are generated:
    - `myMap.yaml`
    - `myMap.pgm`
  
  - Open the myMap.yaml and explain each lines


<!--- NEED TO BE UPDATED ADD A NEW LASER SCAN SOURCE
### 1.5 Change observation source
  - Stop your gmapping node
  - Uncomment the following line in the `gmapping_demo.launch` file
  ```xml
    <arg name="scan_topic"  default="kinect_scan" />
  ```
  - This line changes the observation source from laser to kinect "laser"
  - Start again your gmapping node and try to map the environment
  - What do you observe ? Why ?

### 1.6 ref
  - [https://index.ros.org/p/nav2_map_server/](https://index.ros.org/p/nav2_map_server/)


## 2. Start simulation env.


- Follow the instructions provided in the section **Start Simulation for navigation** of the [readme.md](./readme.md).

- Check that in the env. is correctly load into gazebo (env. plus robot).

- Teleoperate the robot into the simulation.

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

### 2.1 Understand default configuration
- Open the  configuration file `nav2_params_empty.yaml` from the `params/` folder
```yaml

- In this tutorial we will focus on cost map
- What is the difference between `local` and `global_costmap`, What is the purpose of each costmap ?

> - In the global costmap explain the following:
>   - `update_frequency`
>   - `resolution: 0.05`
>   - `static_layer`


### 2.1 Test default configuration

- Try to ask a navigation through riz
    1. Relocate the robot using the **2D Pose Estimate** tool
    1. Ask goal with the **2D Nav Goal** tool

> - What happened when the robot tries to cross a door ? Why ?



## 3. Inflate layer

### 3.1 Configuration

1. Copy the configuration file `nav2_params_empty.yaml` from the `params/` folder to the `params/nav2_params_inflate.yaml`.


### 3.2 Add an inflate layer
In the configuration file **nav2_params_inflate.yaml**, define an inflate layer (follow documentation in [https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/costmap-plugins/inflation.html](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/costmap-plugins/inflation.html)) as follow:
```yaml
global_costmap:
  global_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      update_frequency: 1.0 
      publish_frequency: 1.0
      global_frame: map    
      robot_base_frame: base_link
      use_sim_time: True
      robot_radius: 0.22   
      resolution: 0.05     
      track_unknown_space: true 
      plugins: ["static_layer","inflation_layer"]

        cost_scaling_factor: 3.0
        inflation_radius: 0.55
      static_layer:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::StaticLayer" 
        map_subscribe_transient_local: True   
      always_send_full_costmap: True
...
```

> Find the definition of each parameter:
> - Global parameters:
>    - robot_radius : radius of the robot use to compute cost into inflate layer (refer to inscribed_radius)
> - [Static layer](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/costmap-plugins/static.html)
> - [Inflation layer](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/costmap-plugins/inflation.html)

Restart your simulation for navigation and try a new navigation order through rviz.

 Display the **/global_costmap/costmap** into rviz.

> What happened with the new configuration ? Explain the different robot trajectories ?

### 3.2 Impact of inflate layer parameters on navigation path

Launch the following command:

```
ros2 run rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```

<!-- 
Need a capure of rqt reconfigure here

-->

Play with different values to see the impact on the **/global_costmap/costmap**


Try to make plan into the map through the make_plan service (move_base package) to see the influence of the parameter variations

<!-- TODO FIND THE SERVICE AND COMMAND EXAMPLE
E.g of make_plan command
```
rosservice call /move_base/make_plan "start:
  header:
    seq: 0
    stamp:
      secs: 0
      nsecs: 0
    frame_id: 'map'

> Explain the impact of the parameters. (see [ROS1 inflate layer](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/hydro/inflation))


In gazebo, add an obstacle in front of the robot. Try to send an order of navigation through rviz. What happen ? Why ?


## 4. Obstacle layer


### 4.1 Configuration
1. Copy the configuration file `nav2_params_nav2_params_inflate.yaml` from the `params/` folder to the `params/nav2_params_local_obstacle.yaml`.

2. start the simulator with the new configuration file 


### 4.2 Add an obstacle layer
In the configuration file **nav2_params_local_obstacle.yaml**, define an obstacle layer (follow documentation in costmap_2d) :

Following the document of the [costmap_2d](http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d) explain each parameters.


### 4.3 First test of the obstacle layer

Restart your simulation.

Display the **local_costmap/costmap** into rviz.

In gazebo, add an obstacle in front of the robot (visible by the laser).

> Try to  send an order of navigation through rviz. What happen ? Why ?


### 4.4 Add a custom inflate layer to the local planner

In order to avoid correctly the obstacle, create a new inflate layer into the **nav2_params_local_obstacle.yaml**

```yaml
local_costmap:
  local_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      update_frequency: 5.0
      publish_frequency: 2.0
      global_frame: odom
      robot_base_frame: base_link
      use_sim_time: True
      rolling_window: true
      width: 8
      height: 8
      resolution: 0.05
      robot_radius: 0.22
      #Line below updated
      plugins: ["obstacle_layer","inflation_layer"]
      obstacle_layer:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer"
        enabled: False
        combination_method: 1
        observation_sources: scan
        scan:
          topic: /scan
          max_obstacle_height: 2.0
          clearing: True
          marking: True
          data_type: "LaserScan"
          raytrace_max_range: 3.0
          raytrace_min_range: 0.0
          obstacle_max_range: 2.5
          obstacle_min_range: 0.0
      ##### New Section #####
      inflation_layer:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::InflationLayer"
        cost_scaling_factor: 3.0
        inflation_radius: 0.55
      #######################
      static_layer:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::StaticLayer"
        map_subscribe_transient_local: True
      always_send_full_costmap: True

```


### 4.5 Second test of the obstacle layer

Restart your simulation.

Display the **local_costmap/costmap** into rviz.

In gazebo, add an obstacle in front of the robot (visible by the laser).

> Try to  send an order of navigation (rviz). What happen ? Why ?


### 4.5bis Order of layers
- change the order of layers into the configuration file like following:

```yaml
  ...
 plugins: ["inflation_layer", "obstacle_layer"]
 ...
```
> - Make the test again has explain in 4.5, What happens ? Why ?

- Reset your configuration file to be again in the following configuration 

```yaml
  ...
 plugins: ["obstacle_layer", "inflation_layer"]
 ...
```

### 4.6 Third test of the obstacle layer

Reduce the size of the local costmap window:

```yaml
local_costmap:
 ...
  width: 4
  height: 4
  resolution: 0.05
 ...

```

Restart your simulation.

In gazebo, move your robot into a room with 4 doors.

Add an obstacle into rviz blocking the closest door.

Using rviz, ask your robot to navigate to another room avoiding the new obstacle

> Does the global planner take into account the obstacle ? Why ?

Ask the robot to navigate far from the blocked door. Then ask it again to reach a goal behind the door blocked by the obstacle.
> What happen ? Why ?

> How is it possible to fix that ?



## 6 Add an obstacle layer to the global costmap

### 6.1 Configuration
1. Copy the configuration file `nav2_params_local_obstacle.yaml` from the `params/` folder to the `params/nav2_params_local_global_obstacle.yaml`.

2. Start the simulator with the new configuration file 

### 6.2 Update the global costmap.

As see before, the `planner_server` needs to be informed of new obstacles in order to provide new general trajectories. To do so, the global costmap configuration show be modified:

Modify the **global_costmap** configuration file as follow:

```yaml
global_costmap:
  global_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      update_frequency: 1.0 
      publish_frequency: 1.0
      global_frame: map    
      robot_base_frame: base_link
      use_sim_time: True
      robot_radius: 0.22   
      resolution: 0.05     
      track_unknown_space: true 
      #Line below updated
      plugins: ["static_layer","obstacle_layer", "inflation_layer"]

        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::StaticLayer" 
        map_subscribe_transient_local: True   
      always_send_full_costmap: True
```


### 6.3 Test of the obstacle layer on both local and global costmap

Restart your simulation.

In gazebo, move your robot to a room with 4 doors.

Add an obstacle into rviz that block the closest door.

Through rviz ask your robot to navigation to another room avoiding the new obstacle

> What happen ? Why ? what is the difference with the new  **/global_costmap/costmap** into rviz ? Why ?


## 7. Add 3d obstacle detection

### 7.1 Configuration

1. Copy the configuration file `nav2_params_local_global_obstacle.yaml` from the `params/` folder to the `params/nav2_params_3D_local_global_obstacle.yaml`.

2. Start the simulator with the new configuration file 

### 7.2 First Test with 3D obstacle
Restart your simulation.

Display the **/local_costmap/costmap** into rviz.

In gazebo, add a table obstacle in front of the robot.

Ask the robot to navigate behind the table.

> What happened ? why ?

Display the PointCloud2 of the **/camera/depth/points** topic into rviz.

> What can you conclude ?


### 7.3 Add a source of observation

Go into the **nav2_params_3D_local_global_obstacle.yaml** configuration file and add a new `voxel` costmap layer:

```yaml
local_costmap:
  local_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      update_frequency: 5.0
      publish_frequency: 2.0

> What is the difference between  `voxel_layer` and `obstacle_layer` ?

For a good configuration of the 3D sensor, you must adjust the parameters of the **VoxelCostmapPlugin**. Have a look to the [ROS navigation tuning guide](http://kaiyuzheng.me/documents/navguide.pdf), page 13 to get more detail about Voxel. For Nav2 parameters references you see the following page [Nav2 Voxel Layer]()

- In a nutshell, the following picture sums up Voxel parameters:

### 7.4 Second with 3D obstacle
Restart your simulation.

Display the **local_costmap/costmap** into rviz.

In gazebo, add a table obstacle in front of the robot.

Ask the robot to navigate behind the table.

# BehaviorTree
## Overview
- Nav2 use behavior tree to define the robot reaction during navigation. Behavior trees define an organization of reactions depending of contextual information.
- More information is available here [https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/category/learn-the-basic-concepts](https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/category/learn-the-basic-concepts)

- In behavior tree, we distinguish different type of nodes (quote of the upper link):
  - `ControleNode` : Start a child node based on the result of its siblings or/and its own state.
  - `DecoratorNode`: It may alter the result of its Node child or tick it multiple times.
  - `ConditionNode`: (leaf) Should not alter the system. Shall not return RUNNING.
  - `ActionNode`: (leaf) This is the Node that "does something"

- Below you can show one of the default behavoir tree used in Nav2.

<img src="./img/BTTreeCustom2.png" alt="Default Nav2 Behavior Tree" width="100%"/>

  - This Tree shows one default behavior available in the Nav2 package (here the `navigate_through_poses_w_replanning_and_recovery ` default behavior Tree). In this BTree the following information is found:
    - The Control Node in pink 
    - The Decorator Node in blue
    - The Action Node in white

  - Most of Node are standard BehaviorTree as definied in (https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/category/nodes-library)[https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/category/nodes-library], but Nav2 defines specific behavior nodes like `PipelineSequence`, `NodeRecovery`, `RecoveryRoundRobin` (detail information can be found here [https://navigation.ros.org/behavior_trees/overview/nav2_specific_nodes.html](https://navigation.ros.org/behavior_trees/overview/nav2_specific_nodes.html)). The Nodes list is available here [https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-bt-xml.html](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-bt-xml.html)

  - Below some explanations of both standard BTree Nodes and Nav2 specific Nodes:

    - `Sequence`: A Sequence Node needs to get all its children successful to be successful. When triggered, the first left child is executed, in case of success the sibling right node is then executed and so on. If one children nodes reach failure status Sequence Node returns failure.

    <img src="./img/BTTreeS.png" alt="Default Nav2 Behavior Tree" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>


    - `ReactiveSequence`: The Reactive Sequence execute the first left child.  In case of success, the next right sibling node is executed, but the first one remains active. If the second node reaches successful state the Reactive Sequence return success. If the first child, still active, return a failure state, the second node is haled and the Reactive Sequence return failure.

    - `ReactiveFallback`: The Reactive Fallback Node try to execute a "main" node. In cas of failure a sibling node is triggered but the "main" node remains active. In case of success of the second node the Reactive Fallback Node status becomes successful. In case of success of the "main" node still active, the second node would be stopped and the Reactive Fallback Node status becomes successful.

    - `PipelineSequence` (NAV2): PipeLine sequence acts as a standard `Sequence Node` meaning as soon as a Child Node is successful the next (right) sliding Node is triggered. `Pipeline Sequence` is successful only if all children are successful. The difference is that each time a node is successful it remains active and still check the condition. If a failure occurs all nodes are stopped and `Pipeline Sequence` state becomes failure too.

    - `NodeRecovery` (NAV2): The Node recovery aims at playing the first node until it succeed of a number of try is reached. A second sliding node is played in case of failure of the first one and then the "main" node is played again.

    - `RandRobin` (NAV2): the RandRobin node successively triggers it children (e.g A1,A2,A3,A4) until one is in success. It then memorize the last successful node (e.g A3) and the next time the RandRobin Node is called, it will trigger the sibling node (A4) of the last successful node.


## Navigation Behavior Tree

  - Read again the default Behavior tree `navigate_through_poses_w_replanning_and_recovery`.
  > - Explain how it works when everything is ok.
  > - What happens if the `ComputePathThroughPoses` fails ?
  > - What happens if the `ComputePathThroughPoses` fails (only one time)?
  > - What happens if the `ComputePathThroughPoses` fails despite the first recovery ?
  > - What happens if the `ComputePathThroughPoses` fails despite the second recovery ?


  - Open the Behavior tree `navigate_basic.xml` available in the `behavior_tree` folder

    ```xml
    <root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
    <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
    <PipelineSequence name="NavigateWithReplanning">
      
      <DistanceController distance="1.0">
        <ComputePathToPose goal="{goal}" path="{path}"/>
      </DistanceController>

      <FollowPath path="{path}"/>
    
    </PipelineSequence>
  </BehaviorTree>
</root>
    ```

  > - Explain the given behavior tree
  > - Change the `distance` attribute to `10.0`
  > - Change the parameter `default_nav_through_poses_bt_xml` in the `nav2_params_local.yaml` file to `<your local path>/src/training-turtlebot-simulator-student/simulation/gazebo/gazebo_sim_nav/behavior_tree/navigate_basic.xml``
  > - Run the simulator and explain the new behavior
  > `̀ ` ros2 launch gazebo_sim_nav tb3_simulation_local_launch.py headless:=False params_file:="nav2_params_BT.yaml" `̀ `



  - Tips: you can follow what happened in the behaviour tree of the Nav2 by monitoring log of behavior tree as follows:

  ```
  ros2 topic echo /behavior_tree_log | grep -A2 node_name
  
  ```


  > - Update the behavior with a `Sequence Node` that triggers a `Spin Action` and rotate the robot of 360 degress if the FollowPath is successful
  > - Run the simulator and explain the new behavior


  > - Add a `Recovery Node` that `clear the LocalCost Map` if the `FollowPath Action` failed (Try 3 times)
  > - Run the simulator and explain the new behavior


  > - Update the behavior to clean both Local and the global costmap if the first recovery do not work.
  > - Run the simulator and explain the new behavior
